# CentralToFed-pytorch

The goal of this package is to help in understanding and implementing tests for Federated Learning Systems.  This code aims to allow both experienced and new ML coders test model functionality in a Federated System easily.

Some simple models are included, and using a new model should be easy to implement and pass to the functions.  In addition, this code will have support for utilizing multiple GPUs for accelerating training.

This is based on work I did in my Masters' Capstone, and I decided to revamp it for others to use.
