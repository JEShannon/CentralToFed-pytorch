Current Objectives:

--Finish adapting my capstone code
    --Add code to support using multiple GPUs for training larger models more efficiently
--Test with smaller networks locally to ensure stability and utility.

Future objectives:

--Adapt to a normal Python module for easier use in other projects
--Explore different noise types and budgeting
--Optimize code intended for utilizing multiple GPUs
